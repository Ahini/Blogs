# Day 5 - Introduction to Shell Scripting

Shell scripting might sound intimidating, but it's essentially about telling your computer what to do in a language it understands. Think of it like writing a recipe for a dish you loveâ€”step-by-step instructions to achieve a delicious outcome. In this blog, we'll break down what shell scripting is, why it's useful, and how you can get started with it, all in simple terms.

### What is Shell Scripting?

Imagine you have a personal assistant. You give them tasks, and they carry them out. In the world of computers, the shell is your assistant, and shell scripting is the set of instructions you give. The shell is a command-line interface where you can type commands, and shell scripts are files containing a series of these commands.

### Why Use Shell Scripting?

1. **Automation**: Automate repetitive tasks like file backups, system updates, or data processing.
    
2. **Efficiency**: Save time by running scripts instead of typing commands manually.
    
3. **Consistency**: Ensure tasks are performed the same way every time, reducing the chance of errors.
    
4. **Power**: Perform complex tasks with simple scripts.
    

### Getting Started with Shell Scripting

1. **Open Your Terminal**: On most systems, you can open the terminal from the applications menu. On Windows, you can use Git Bash or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
    
2. **Create a Script File**: Use a text editor (like Notepad on Windows, or nano/vi on Unix systems) to create a new file with a `.sh` extension. For example, [`myscript.sh`](http://myscript.sh).
    
3. **Write Your First Script**: Start with a simple script. Open your text editor and type the following:
    
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    echo "Hello, World!"
    ```
    
    * `#!/bin/bash` tells the system to use the Bash shell to interpret the script.
        
    * `echo "Hello, World!"` prints "Hello, World!" to the terminal.
        
4. **Save and Run Your Script**:
    
    * Save your file and close the text editor.
        
    * In the terminal, navigate to the directory where you saved your script.
        
    * Make your script executable by running: `chmod +x`[`myscript.sh`](http://myscript.sh)
        
    * Run your script by typing: `./`[`myscript.sh`](http://myscript.sh)
        

### Basic Shell Commands

Here are a few basic shell commands to get you started:

* `pwd`: Print the current working directory.
    
* `ls`: List files and directories.
    
* `cd [directory]`: Change to the specified directory.
    
* `cp [source] [destination]`: Copy files or directories.
    
* `mv [source] [destination]`: Move or rename files or directories.
    
* `rm [file]`: Remove a file.
    
* `mkdir [directory]`: Create a new directory.
    

### Adding Logic to Your Scripts

Shell scripting isn't just about running commands; you can add logic to make your scripts smarter.

#### Variables

Variables store information that your script can use.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
name="Alice"
echo "Hello, $name!"
```

#### Conditional Statements

Run commands based on certain conditions.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
if [ -f "$1" ]; then
    echo "File $1 exists."
else
    echo "File $1 does not exist."
fi
```

#### Loops

Run commands multiple times.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
for i in {1..5}
do
   echo "Iteration $i"
done
```

### Conclusion

Shell scripting is like writing a set of instructions for your computer to follow. With a bit of practice, you can automate tedious tasks, keep your files organized, and even enhance your daily routines. Start simple, experiment with scripts, and gradually build your skills. Soon, you'll see the power of shell scripting in making your life easier and more efficient.

Happy scripting!
