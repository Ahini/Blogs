# Day 8 - Linux Permissions

## What Are Permissions?

In Linux, permissions control who can read, write, or execute files and directories. Think of it as a security system that determines what users can and cannot do with files and directories on the system.

## The Basics of Permissions

Permissions in Linux are divided into three categories:

1. **Read (r)**: Allows you to open and view the contents of a file.
    
2. **Write (w)**: Allows you to modify the contents of a file.
    
3. **Execute (x)**: Allows you to run a file as a program.
    

These permissions can be assigned to three types of users:

1. **Owner**: The user who owns the file.
    
2. **Group**: A set of users who are given the same permissions.
    
3. **Others**: Everyone else.
    

## Viewing Permissions

You can view the permissions of a file or directory by using the `ls -l` command in the terminal. Here's an example of what you might see:

```bash
-rw-r--r-- 1 user group 4096 Jul 13 10:00 example.txt
```

Let's break this down:

* `-rw-r--r--`: This string of characters represents the permissions.
    
    * The first character (`-`) indicates the type of file. A dash (-) means a regular file. If it were a directory, it would be a `d`.
        
    * The next three characters (`rw-`) represent the owner's permissions. Here, the owner can read and write the file.
        
    * The next three characters (`r--`) represent the group's permissions. Here, the group can only read the file.
        
    * The last three characters (`r--`) represent the permissions for others. Here, others can also only read the file.
        

## Truth Table

| Number | Read | Write | Execute | Permission Type | Symbol |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | No Permission | \- - - |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | Execute | \- - x |
| 2 | 0 | 1 | 0 | Write | \- w - |
| 3 | 0 | 1 | 1 | Execute + Write | \- w x |
| 4 | 1 | 0 | 0 | Read | r - - |
| 5 | 1 | 0 | 1 | Read + Execute | r - x |
| 6 | 1 | 1 | 0 | Read +Write | r w - |
| 7 | 1 | 1 | 1 | Read + Write + Execute | r w x |

Equating by the above table, let's take an example

1. 664
    
    1. Read, Write for User
        
    2. Read, Write for Group
        
    3. Read for others
        
    
    It will become `rw-rw-r--`
    
2. 700
    
    1. Read, Write, Execute for User
        
    2. No permission for group
        
    3. No permission for other
        
    
    It will become `rwx------`
    
3. 777
    
    1. Read, Write, Execute for User
        
    2. Read, Write, Execute for Group
        
    3. Read, Write, Execute for Others
        
    
    It will become `rwxrwxrwx`
    

## Conclusion

Permissions are crucial for maintaining the security and integrity of your system. They prevent unauthorized users from accessing or modifying important files. By understanding and properly setting permissions, you can protect your data and ensure that your system runs smoothly.
