Day 4 - SSH (Secure Shell) connectivity process

Let us understand SSH with our very known ancient Indian epic

## RAMAYANA 👑🏹👸🐒🦅🌳🔥🗡️

* **Shri Ram (**[**Localhost**](http://Localhost)**)**
    
* **Sita Maiya (Remote Host)**
    
* **Hanumanji (SSH)**
    
* **Ring (Private Key)**
    

## Explanation

* ### Shri Ram Quests to Reach Sita Maiya
    

> Your computer , seek to connect and command a remote machine.

* ### Hanumanji leaps into Action
    

> Initiating the SSH connection is like Hanumanji's leap, sending a secure protocol across the network.

* ### Hanumanji Bears the Ring
    

> The SSH protocol carries your private key, akin to Hanumanji carrying the precious ring, your credential for authentication.

* ### Reaching Sita Maiya
    

> The SSH protocol securely links you to the remote machine, reaching Sita Maiya's realm.

* ### Verifying the Ring
    

> The remote machine confirms your identity by checking the private key you've presented.

* ### Access Granted
    

> When your private key matches the remote machine's stored key, access is granted—empowering you to guide and control the remote machine, much like Shri Ram guiding Hanumanji.
