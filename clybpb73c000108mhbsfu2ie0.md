# Day 2 : Case study about companies that failed due to the lack of DevOps principles

Big companies???????

Yes they too do huge mistakes with obviously huge losses.

Fault is the they neglected DevOps principles and thought of continuing in their traditional manner.

## Nokia

Once an undefeatable player in the world of mobile phones, once our favourite brand, used to be a big name but had a hard time keeping up when smartphones became popular. They were slow to adapt to what people wanted and didn't innovate much with their software and overall system. Because of this, they lost a lot of their market share and their financial performance suffered.

## Gitlab

Developers' favourite. In 2017, GitLab, a website for managing code, had a big data loss because someone made a mistake while moving the database. They lost six hours of data, and it took a lot of time and effort to get everything back to normal. This showed how important it is to have good backup and recovery plans in place, which are key parts of DevOps work.

## Knight Capital Group

$440 million in 45 minutes ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±?????????????? Yes.

In 2012, Knight Capital Group, a financial services company, had a big technical problem because of a mistake in their trading software update. This error caused a lot of wrong trades, leading to a loss of over $440 million in just 45 minutes. The huge loss almost made the company go bankrupt.

## **TSB Bank**

In 2018, the British bank TSB tried to move its customer data to a new computer system. This caused many problems, like customers not being able to access their accounts and some transactions happening twice. The messed-up move led to weeks of service problems and cost the bank about Â£330 million ($455 million).

And many more.

### Conclusion : United we deploy, divided we make losses. Where we denotes to all the developers, operators and also the companies upskilling.
