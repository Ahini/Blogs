## Why use Linux?

* **Free and Open Source**: Linux is free to use, and its source code is open for anyone to view, modify, and distribute.
    
* **Security**: Linux is known for its strong security features, making it less vulnerable to viruses and malware.
    
* **Stability**: Linux systems are highly stable and rarely crash, making them ideal for servers and critical applications.
    
* **Performance**: Linux can run efficiently on older hardware, providing excellent performance even on less powerful machines.
    
* **Customization**: You can tailor Linux to meet your specific needs, from the desktop environment to the core system components.
    
* **Support Community**: A large, active community offers support, documentation, and a wealth of resources to help users troubleshoot and optimize their systems.
    
* **Variety of Distributions**: With many distributions available, you can choose one that best suits your needs, whether it's for general use, programming, or specialized tasks.
    
* **Compatibility**: Linux supports a wide range of hardware and software, making it a flexible choice for various applications.
    
* **Privacy**: Linux respects user privacy, with many distributions focusing on minimal data collection and user control over their information.
    

## Unix vs Linux

Today, Linux is very popular and widely used. You can find it running on servers, desktops, smartphones, and even in some electrical devices like refrigerators.

While some people think Unix and Linux are the same, they are not. Many operating systems tried to be like Unix, but none became as popular as Linux. Linux is a clone of Unix, sharing many features but also having key differences.

Before Linux and Windows, Unix was the dominant operating system. Unix is a copyrighted name, and now only a few versions like IBM AIX, HP-UX, and Sun Solaris are still around.

## Difference between Linux and Unix

| Comparison | Linux üêß | Unix üñ•Ô∏è |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Definition** | It is an open-source operating system which is freely available to everyone. | It is an operating system which can be only used by its copyrighters. |
| **Examples** | It has different distros like Ubuntu, Redhat, Fedora, etc | IBM AIX, HP-UX and Sun Solaris |
| **Users** | Nowadays, Linux is in great demand. Anyone can use Linux whether a home user, developer or a student. | It was developed mainly for servers, workstations and mainframes. |
| **Usage** | Linux is used everywhere from servers, PC, smartphones, tablets to mainframes and supercomputers. | It is used in servers, workstations and PCs. |
| **Cost** | Linux is freely distributed, downloaded, and distributed through magazines also. And priced distros of Linux are also cheaper than Windows. | Unix copyright vendors decide different costs for their respective Unix Operating systems. |
| **Development** | As it is open source, it is developed by sharing and collaboration of codes by world-wide developers. | Unix was developed by AT&T Labs, various commercial vendors and nonprofit organizations. |
| **Manufacturer** | Linux kernel is developed by the community of developers from different parts of the world. Although the father of Linux, Linus Torvalds oversees things. | Unix has three distributions IBM AIX, HP-UX and Sun Solaris. Apple also uses Unix to make OSX operating system. |
| **GUI** | Linux is command based but some distros provide GUI based Linux. Gnome and KDE are mostly used GUI. | Initially it was command based OS, but later Common Desktop Environment was created. Most Unix distributions use Gnome. |
| **Interface** | The default interface is BASH (Bourne Again SHell). But some distros have developed their own interfaces. | It originally used Bourne shell. But is also compatible with other GUIs. |
| **File system support** | Linux supports more file system than Unix. | It also supports file system but lesser than Linux. |
| **Coding** | Linux is a Unix clone, behaves like Unix but doesn't contain its code. | Unix contain a completely different coding developed by AT&T Labs. |
| **Operating system** | Linux is just the kernel. | Unix is a complete package of Operating system. |
| **Security** | It provides higher security. Linux has about 60-100 viruses listed till date. | Unix is also highly secured. It has about 85-120 viruses listed till date |
| **Error detection and solution** | As Linux is open-source, whenever a user post any kind of threat, developers from all over the world start working on it. And hence, it provides faster solution. | In Unix, users have to wait for some time for the problem to be resolved. |
